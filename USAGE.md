# My personal landing page

This repository is the source for my [personal landing page](https://stephen.glass). The project uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for bundling and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for a lightwieght UI library.

- `npm run dev` - Starts a dev server at <http://localhost:5173/>

- `npm run build` - Builds for production, emitting to `dist/`

- `npm run preview` - Starts a server at <http://localhost:4173/> to test production build locally
